# Reorganization of Repo 

### High Certainty 

- Pull out common 
- Make common.yaml and pull out in terragrunt
- Build efficient remote state handling system to deal with 
- init dir 
    - Packer builds 
- Rename vpcs by full name 
- Give account alias and index buckets with that naming instead of account_id 
    - Need to put in init dir 

### Long Term 

- Package all in docker containers
